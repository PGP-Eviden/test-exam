You want to scale as usage increases and ensure that you don't run out of storage, maintain 75% CPU usage cores, and keep replication lag below 60 seconds. What are the correct steps to meet your requirements?", ""], "options": ["1. Enable automatic storage increase for the instance. 2. Create a Stackdriver alert when CPU usage exceeds 75%, and change the instance type to reduce CPU usage. 3. Create a Stackdriver alert for replication lag, and shard the database to reduce replication time.", "1. Enable automatic storage increase for the instance. 2.
