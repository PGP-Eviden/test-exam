{"title": "Topic 001 Question 029", "body": ["You support a high-traffic web application with a microservice architecture. The home page of the application displays multiple widgets containing content such as the current weather, stock prices, and news headlines. The main serving thread makes a call to a dedicated microservice for each widget and then lays out the homepage for the user. The microservices occasionally fail; when that happens, the serving thread serves the homepage with some missing content. Users of the application are unhappy if this degraded mode occurs too frequently, but they would rather have some content served instead of no content at all. You want to set a Service Level Objective (SLO) to ensure that the user experience does not degrade too much. What Service Level Indicator (SLI) should you use to measure this?", ""], "options": ["A quality SLI: the ratio of non-degraded responses to total responses.", "An availability SLI: the ratio of healthy microservices to the total number of microservices.", "A freshness SLI: the proportion of widgets that have been updated within the last 10 minutes.", "A latency SLI: the ratio of microservice calls that complete in under 100 ms to the total number of microservice calls."], "answer": "A"}
