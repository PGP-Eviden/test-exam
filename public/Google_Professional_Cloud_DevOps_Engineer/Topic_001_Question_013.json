{"title": "Topic 001 Question 013", "body": ["You are performing a semi-annual capacity planning exercise for your flagship service. You expect a service user growth rate of 10% month-over-month over the next six months. Your service is fully containerized and runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Standard regional cluster on three zones with cluster autoscaler enabled. You currently consume about 30% of your total deployed CPU capacity, and you require resilience against the failure of a zone. You want to ensure that your users experience minimal negative impact as a result of this growth or as a result of zone failure, while avoiding unnecessary costs. How should you prepare to handle the predicted growth?", ""], "options": ["Verify the maximum node pool size, enable a horizontal pod autoscaler, and then perform a load test to verify your expected resource needs.", "Because you are deployed on GKE and are using a cluster autoscaler, your GKE cluster will scale automatically, regardless of growth rate.", "Because you are at only 30% utilization, you have significant headroom and you won't need to add any additional capacity for this rate of growth.", "Proactively add 60% more node capacity to account for six months of 10% growth rate, and then perform a load test to make sure you have enough capacity."], "answer": "A"}
