The solution will provision the EC2 instance with an IAM role that has the permissions necessary to make API calls to other AWS services in the same AWS account. The security team can create the AMI for this EC2 instance. The team encrypts the AMI by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key.", "", "When the team invokes the Lambda function to launch the EC2 instance, the team receives an access denied error message from the Lambda function\u2019s execution role. The team analyzes the Lambda function execution role for missing permissions.", "", "What is the MOST likely cause of this error message?"], "options": ["The Lambda function\u2019s execution role does not have kms:CreateGrant and kms:Decrypt KMS key permissions for the encrypted AMI.", "The Lambda function's execution role does not have iam:PassRole permission for the requested IAM instance profile.", "The company has reached the account's service quota for the EC2 instance type that the Lambda function is provisioning in the AWS Region.", "The Lambda function\u2019s execution role does not have Amazon CloudWatch read and write permissions for the configured CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instance."], "answer": "B"}
