When full load is finished, cut over any application endpoints to the new encrypted database.", "Create a snapshot of the noncompliant DB instance. Make a copy of the snapshot in the same AWS Region with encryption configured. Restore the snapshot as a new DB instance. Cut over any application endpoints to the newly restored database.", "Deploy a patch to the application to stop writing to the noncompliant database. Enable storage encryption by using the AWS CLI. Patch the application again to restore writing to the database.", "Add a read replica to the noncompliant DB instance. Enable storage encryption on the read replica. When the read replica is available, cut over from the writer DB instance to the read replica. Delete the unencrypted DB instance after the cutover."], "answer": "A"}
