The company supports agricultural production resources by distributing seeds fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery to the farms.","","","Current Environment"," -","","The company is migrating all applications from an on-premises datacenter to Microsoft Azure. Applications support distributors, farmers, and internal company staff.","","","Corporate website"," -","•\tThe company hosts a public website located at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com. The site supports farmers and distributors who request agricultural production resources.","","","Farms"," -","•\tThe company created a new customer tenant in the Microsoft Entra admin center to support authentication and authorization for applications.","","","Distributors"," -","•\tDistributors integrate their applications with data that is accessible by using APIs hosted at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com/api to receive and update resource data.","","","Requirements"," -","","The application components must meet the following requirements:","","","Corporate website"," -","•\tThe site must be migrated to Azure App Service.","•\tCosts must be minimized when hosting in Azure.","•\tApplications must automatically scale independent of the compute resources.","•\tAll code changes must be validated by internal staff before release to production.","•\tFile transfer speeds must improve, and webpage-load performance must increase.","•\tAll site settings must be centrally stored, secured without using secrets, and encrypted at rest and in transit.","•\tA queue-based load leveling pattern must be implemented by using Azure Service Bus queues to support high volumes of website agricultural production resource requests.","","","Farms"," -","•\tFarmers must authenticate to applications by using Microsoft Entra ID.","","","Distributors"," -","•\tThe company must track a custom telemetry value with each API call and monitor performance of all APIs.","•\tAPI telemetry values must be charted to evaluate variations and trends for resource data.","","","Internal staff"," -","•\tApp and API updates must be validated before release to production.","•\tStaff must be able to select a link to direct them back to the production app when validating an app or API update.","•\tStaff profile photos and email must be displayed on the website once they authenticate to applications by using their Microsoft Entra ID.","","","Security"," -","•\tAll web communications must be secured by using TLS/HTTPS.","•\tWeb content must be restricted by country/region to support corporate compliance standards.","•\tThe principle of least privilege must be applied when providing any user rights or process access rights.","•\tManaged identities for Azure resources must be used to authenticate services that support Microsoft Entra ID authentication.","","","Issues"," -","","","Corporate website"," -","•\tFarmers report HTTP 503 errors at the same time as internal staff report that CPU and memory usage are high.","•\tDistributors report HTTP 502 errors at the same time as internal staff report that average response times and networking traffic are high.","•\tInternal staff report webpage load sizes are large and take a long time to load.","•\tDevelopers receive authentication errors to Service Bus when they debug locally.","","","Distributors"," -","•\tMany API telemetry values are sent in a short period of time. Telemetry traffic, data costs, and storage costs must be reduced while preserving a statistically correct analysis of the data points sent by the APIs.","","","You need to resolve the authentication errors for developers.","","Which Service Bus security configuration should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.","","NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.","","\u003cimg\u003e/Microsoft AZ-204/img/image517.png\u003cimg\u003e"],"options":["\u003cimg\u003e/Microsoft AZ-204/img/image518.png\u003cimg\u003e"],"answer":"","et_answer":""}
