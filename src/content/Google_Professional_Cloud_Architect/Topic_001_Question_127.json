{"title": "Topic 001 Question 127", "body": ["Your operations team has asked you to help diagnose a performance issue in a production application that runs on Compute Engine. The application is dropping requests that reach it when under heavy load. The process list for affected instances shows a single application process that is consuming all available CPU, and autoscaling has reached the upper limit of instances. There is no abnormal load on any other related systems, including the database. You want to allow production traffic to be served again as quickly as possible. Which action should you recommend?", ""], "options": ["Change the autoscaling metric to agent.googleapis.com/memory/percent_used.", "Restart the affected instances on a staggered schedule.", "SSH to each instance and restart the application process.", "Increase the maximum number of instances in the autoscaling group."], "answer": "D"}
