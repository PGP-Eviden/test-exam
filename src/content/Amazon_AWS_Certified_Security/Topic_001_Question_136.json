{"title":"Topic 001 Question 136","body":["A company has decided to migrate sensitive documents from on-premises data centers to Amazon S3. Currently, the hard drives are encrypted to meet a compliance requirement regarding data encryption. The CISO wants to improve security by encrypting each file using a different key instead of a single key. Using a different key would limit the security impact of a single exposed key.","Which of the following requires the LEAST amount of configuration when implementing this approach?",""],"options":["Place each file into a different S3 bucket. Set the default encryption of each bucket to use a different AWS KMS customer managed key.","Put all the files in the same S3 bucket. Using S3 events as a trigger, write an AWS Lambda function to encrypt each file as it is added using different AWS KMS data keys.","Use the S3 encryption client to encrypt each file individually using S3-generated data keys.","Place all the files in the same S3 bucket. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) to encrypt the data."],"answer":"D","et_answer":"x"}
