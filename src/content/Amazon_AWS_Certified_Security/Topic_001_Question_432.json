{"title":"Topic 001 Question 432","body":["A developer has created an AWS Lambda function in a company’s development account. The Lambda function requires the use of an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key that exists in a security account that the company’s security team controls. The developer obtains the ARN of the KMS key from a previous Lambda function in the development account. The previous Lambda function had been working properly with the KMS key.","","When the developer uses the ARN and tests the new Lambda function, an error message states that access is denied to the KMS key in the security account. The developer tests the previous Lambda function that uses the same KMS key and discovers that the previous Lambda function still can encrypt data as expected.","","A security engineer must resolve the problem so that the new Lambda function in the development account can use the KMS key from the security account.","","Which combination of steps should the security engineer take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)"],"options":["In the security account, configure an IAM role for the new Lambda function. Attach an IAM policy that allows access to the KMS key in the security account.","In the development account, configure an IAM role for the new Lambda function. Attach a key policy that allows access to the KMS key in the security account.","In the development account, configure an IAM role for the new Lambda function.
