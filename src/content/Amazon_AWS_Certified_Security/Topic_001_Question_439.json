{"title":"Topic 001 Question 439","body":["A companyâ€™s application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance and stores objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance is using an instance profile that provides access to read and write objects in the S3 bucket. The S3 bucket contains objects and has not been configured for any encryption at rest. The company is adopting a new security policy that mandates encryption at rest for all S3 buckets, encryption at rest for all objects in S3 buckets, and key rotation once every year.","","What should a security engineer do to meet these requirements?"],"options":["Enable server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) for the S3 bucket. Configure annual automatic key rotation. Use an S3 Batch Operations job with the COPY command to change all the objects in the S3 bucket to use the SSE-S3 key. Configure the EC2 instance profile with permissions to use the SSE-S3 key. Configure S3 data events to encrypt an object during a write operation.","Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Configure annual automatic key rotation. Enable server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) for the S3 bucket. Add a bucket policy to the S3 bucket to enforce SSE-KMS encryption.
