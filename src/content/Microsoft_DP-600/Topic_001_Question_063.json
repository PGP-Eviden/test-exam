The analytics team at Litware contains data engineers, analytics engineers, data analysts, and data scientists.","","","Existing Environment -","","","Fabric Environment -","","Litware has been using a Microsoft Power BI tenant for three years. Litware has NOT enabled any Fabric capacities and features.","","","Available Data -","","Litware has data that must be analyzed as shown in the following table.","","\u003cimg\u003e/Microsoft DP-600/img/image78.png\u003cimg\u003e","","The Product data contains a single table and the following columns.","","\u003cimg\u003e/Microsoft DP-600/img/image79.png\u003cimg\u003e","","The customer satisfaction data contains the following tables:","","•\tSurvey","•\tQuestion","•\tResponse","","For each survey submitted, the following occurs:","","•\tOne row is added to the Survey table.","•\tOne row is added to the Response table for each question in the survey.","","The Question table contains the text of each survey question. The third question in each survey response is an overall satisfaction score. Customers can submit a survey after each purchase.","","","User Problems -","","The analytics team has large volumes of data, some of which is semi-structured. The team wants to use Fabric to create a new data store.","","Product data is often classified into three pricing groups: high, medium, and low. This logic is implemented in several databases and semantic models, but the logic does NOT always match across implementations.","","","Requirements -","","","Planned Changes -","","Litware plans to enable Fabric features in the existing tenant. The analytics team will create a new data store as a proof of concept (PoC). The remaining Liware users will only get access to the Fabric features once the PoC is complete. The PoC will be completed by using a Fabric trial capacity","","The following three workspaces will be created:","","•\tAnalyticsPOC: Will contain the data store, semantic models, reports pipelines, dataflow, and notebooks used to populate the data store","•\tDataEngPOC: Will contain all the pipelines, dataflows, and notebooks used to populate OneLake","•\tDataSciPOC: Will contain all the notebooks and reports created by the data scientists","","The following will be created in the AnalyticsPOC workspace:","","•\tA data store (type to be decided)","•\tA custom semantic model","•\tA default semantic model","•\tInteractive reports","","The data engineers will create data pipelines to load data to OneLake either hourly or daily depending on the data source. The analytics engineers will create processes to ingest, transform, and load the data to the data store in the AnalyticsPOC workspace daily. Whenever possible, the data engineers will use low-code tools for data ingestion. The choice of which data cleansing and transformation tools to use will be at the data engineers’ discretion.","","All the semantic models and reports in the Analytics POC workspace will use the data store as the sole data source.","","","Technical Requirements -","","The data store must support the following:","","•\tRead access by using T-SQL or Python","•\tSemi-structured and unstructured data","•\tRow-level security (RLS) for users executing T-SQL queries","","Files loaded by the data engineers to OneLake will be stored in the Parquet format and will meet Delta Lake specifications.","","Data will be loaded without transformation in one area of the AnalyticsPOC data store. The data will then be cleansed, merged, and transformed into a dimensional model","","The data load process must ensure that the raw and cleansed data is updated completely before populating the dimensional model","","The dimensional model must contain a date dimension. There is no existing data source for the date dimension. The Litware fiscal year matches the calendar year. The date dimension must always contain dates from 2010 through the end of the current year.","","The product pricing group logic must be maintained by the analytics engineers in a single location. The pricing group data must be made available in the data store for T-SOL. queries and in the default semantic model. The following logic must be used:","","•\tList prices that are less than or equal to 50 are in the low pricing group.","•\tList prices that are greater than 50 and less than or equal to 1,000 are in the medium pricing group.","•\tList prices that are greater than 1,000 are in the high pricing group.","","","Security Requirements -","","Only Fabric administrators and the analytics team must be able to see the Fabric items created as part of the PoC.","","Litware identifies the following security requirements for the Fabric items in the AnalyticsPOC workspace:","","•\tFabric administrators will be the workspace administrators.","•\tThe data engineers must be able to read from and write to the data store. No access must be granted to datasets or reports.","•\tThe analytics engineers must be able to read from, write to, and create schemas in the data store. They also must be able to create and share semantic models with the data analysts and view and modify all reports in the workspace.","•\tThe data scientists must be able to read from the data store, but not write to it. They will access the data by using a Spark notebook","•\tThe data analysts must have read access to only the dimensional model objects in the data store. They also must have access to create Power BI reports by using the semantic models created by the analytics engineers.","•\tThe date dimension must be available to all users of the data store.","•\tThe principle of least privilege must be followed.","","Both the default and custom semantic models must include only tables or views from the dimensional model in the data store. Litware already has the following Microsoft Entra security groups:","","•\tFabricAdmins: Fabric administrators","•\tAnalyticsTeam: All the members of the analytics team","•\tDataAnalysts: The data analysts on the analytics team","•\tDataScientists: The data scientists on the analytics team","•\tDataEngineers: The data engineers on the analytics team","•\tAnalyticsEngineers: The analytics engineers on the analytics team","","","Report Requirements -","","The data analysts must create a customer satisfaction report that meets the following requirements:","","•\tEnables a user to select a product to filter customer survey responses to only those who have purchased that product.","•\tDisplays the average overall satisfaction score of all the surveys submitted during the last 12 months up to a selected dat.","•\tShows data as soon as the data is updated in the data store.","•\tEnsures that the report and the semantic model only contain data from the current and previous year.","•\tEnsures that the report respects any table-level security specified in the source data store.","•\tMinimizes the execution time of report queries.","","","You need to ensure the data loading activities in the AnalyticsPOC workspace are executed in the appropriate sequence. The solution must meet the technical requirements.","","What should you do?\r"],"options":["Create a dataflow that has multiple steps and schedule the dataflow.\r","Create and schedule a Spark notebook.\r","Create and schedule a Spark job definition.\r","Create a pipeline that has dependencies between activities and schedule the pipeline.\r"],"answer":"D","et_answer":"D"}
