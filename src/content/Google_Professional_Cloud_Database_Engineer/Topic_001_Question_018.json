Your users run reports on data that relies on near-real time; however, the additional analytics caused excessive load on the primary database. You created a read replica for the analytics workloads, but now your users are complaining about the lag in data changes and that their reports are still slow. You need to improve the report performance and shorten the lag in data replication without making changes to the current reports. Which two approaches should you implement?
