{"title":"Topic 001 Question 119","body":["You are the DBA of an online tutoring application that runs on a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL database. You are testing the implementation of the cross-regional failover configuration. The database in region R1 fails over successfully to region R2, and the database becomes available for the application to process data. During testing, certain scenarios of the application work as expected in region R2, but a few scenarios fail with database errors. The application-related database queries, when executed in isolation from Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL in region R2, work as expected. The application performs completely as expected when the database fails back to region R1. You need to identify the cause of the database errors in region R2. What should you do?"],"options":["Determine whether the versions of Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL in regions R1 and R2 are different.","Determine whether the database patches of Cloud SQI for PostgreSQL in regions R1 and R2 are different.","Determine whether the failover of Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL from region R1 to region R2 is in progress or has completed successfully.","Determine whether Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL in region R2 is a near-real-time copy of region R1 but not an exact copy."],"answer":"D","et_answer":"x"}
