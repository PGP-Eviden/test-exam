Each workspace is connected to an Azure Data Lake Storage account and contains a lake database that is accessed by using the built-in serverless SQL pool. The data in the Data Lake Storage accounts is available in the lake databases for analysts from every business unit to query and analyze by using Power BI.","","The company imports the following files into the Data Lake Storage accounts:","","•\tUser experience data stored as JSON files","•\tFinance data stored as CSV files","•\tSales data stored as CSV files","","","Reporting"," -","","Fabrikam has a Power BI tenant that contains 30 workspaces in Pro license mode. The data in the workspaces is a mix of Import and DirectQueiy datasets. All reports are interactive.","","Fabrikam has three frequently used workspaces as shown in the following table.","","\u003cimg\u003e/Microsoft DP-500/img/image175.png\u003cimg\u003e","","The Corporate Data Models workspace contains a dataset named Financial Model that is used by reports in the P\u0026amp;L workspace. Financial Model is maintained by the enterprise analytics team. The Corporate Data Models workspace and the User Experience workspace have corresponding development and test workspaces.","","","User Problems"," -","","Administrators report an increase in the maintenance of Power BI tenant assets due to analysts in the Finance and Accounting business unit who create new Power BI datasets when the existing datasets already meet their needs.","","Analysts in the Product business unit report the following issues:","","•\tDatasets are published to the User Experience workspace, while the data sources reference workspace1test.","•\tThe parsing of user experience data in Power Query is very slow.","","The enterprise analytics team identifies two DAX measures in the Financial Model dataset that are consistently slow to execute. The team must identify all the reports that use the Financial Model dataset and notify the report owners of changes to the measures.","","Members of the enterprise analytics team report that creating Power BI reports and adjusting tables and views in Azure Synapse is tedious because they must switch between the Power BI workspaces and the Azure Synapse workspaces.","","The information security team identifies that the user experience data is being shared externally.","","","Requirements"," -","","","Planned Changes"," -","","Fabrikam plans to implement the following changes:","","•\tPower BI will be registered as a data source in Microsoft Purview.","•\tThe analysts in the Product business unit will create a more automated process for deploying Power BI reports and datasets to the User Experience workspace.","","The enterprise analytics team plans to perform the following tasks:","","•\tUpdate the DAX calculations in the Financial Model dataset.","•\tCreate views in the Azure Synapse workspaces to speed up the parsing of user experience data.","•\tCreate and document the change management process for shared Power BI datasets.","","","Technical Requirements"," -","","From Microsoft Purview, analysts in all the business units must be able to see all the assets in the Power BI tenant and the Azure Synapse workspaces. Power BI asset information must include lineage to identify the data sources used by each report.","","The information security team must identify all the Power BI reports and datasets that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII).","","Fabrikam requires a security solution for the Power BI tenant. The solution must meet the following requirements:","","•\tAccess to the tenant by external users must be approved by a manager and granted by the IT group.","•\tThe external users must be prevented from publishing or modifying content in the tenant.","•\tUsers must be prevented from sharing Power BI reports publicly to the internet.","","The new process for deploying Power BI reports and datasets to the User Experience workspace must ensure that the datasets point to the lake database to which the relevant dataset is deployed. The views in each lake database must present the data in a tabular format.","","","You need to recommend a security solution for the Power BI tenant to control external data sharing. The solution must meet the technical requirements.","","What should you recommend?
