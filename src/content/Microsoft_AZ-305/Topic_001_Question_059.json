The company has a main office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Rome.","","Existing Environment: Active Directory Environment","","The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There are no trust relationships between the forests.","","Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and computer authentication.","","Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R\u0026amp;D) department only. The R\u0026amp;D department is restricted to using on-premises resources only.","","Existing Environment: Network Infrastructure","","Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest.","","All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet.","","An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V.","","The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1.","","Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes Software Assurance.","","Existing Environment: Problem Statements","","The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many resources for WebApp1 are underutilized.","","","Requirements: Planned Changes"," -","","Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years, including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication.","","As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment.","","All R\u0026amp;D operations will remain on-premises.","","Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure.","","Requirements: Technical Requirements","","Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:","","•\tWebsite content must be easily updated from a single point.","•\tUser input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances.","•\tWhenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost.","•\tUsers must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity.","•\tAny new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.","•\tWhenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure App Service.","•\tAn email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services.","•\tIn the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory.","•\tDirectory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on-premises network.","","Requirements: Database Requirements","","Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:","","•\tDatabase metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings.","•\tTo avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated.","•\tDatabase backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements.","","Requirements: Security Requirements","","Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements:","","•\tCompany information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside the company.","•\tUsers on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet link fails.","•\tAdministrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com credentials.","•\tAll administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication (MFA).","•\tThe testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company.","","","To meet the authentication requirements of Fabrikam, what should you include in the solution? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.","","NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.","","\u003cimg\u003e/Microsoft AZ-305/img/image198.png\u003cimg\u003e"],"options":["\u003cimg\u003e/Microsoft AZ-305/img/image199.png\u003cimg\u003e"],"answer":""}
