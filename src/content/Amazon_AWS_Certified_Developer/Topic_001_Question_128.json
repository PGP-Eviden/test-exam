Deploy the new application code, and test it. Swap the environment URLs upon verification.","Deploy the new application code in an all-at-once deployment to the existing EC2 instances. Test the code. Redeploy the previous code if verification fails.","Perform an immutable update to deploy the new application code to new EC2 instances. Serve traffic to the new instances after they pass health checks.","Use a rolling deployment for the new application code. Apply the code to a subset of EC2 instances until the tests pass.
