{"title":"Topic 001 Question 002","body":["A company is running Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS accounts. A developer needs to implement an application that collects all the lifecycle events of the EC2 instances. The application needs to store the lifecycle events in a single Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in the company's main AWS account for further processing.","Which solution will meet these requirements?"],"options":["Configure Amazon EC2 to deliver the EC2 instance lifecycle events from all accounts to the Amazon EventBridge event bus of the main account. Add an EventBridge rule to the event bus of the main account that matches all EC2 instance lifecycle events. Add the SQS queue as a target of the rule.","Use the resource policies of the SQS queue in the main account to give each account permissions to write to that SQS queue. Add to the Amazon EventBridge event bus of each account an EventBridge rule that matches all EC2 instance lifecycle events. Add the SQS queue in the main account as a target of the rule.","Write an AWS Lambda function that scans through all EC2 instances in the company accounts to detect EC2 instance lifecycle changes. Configure the Lambda function to write a notification message to the SQS queue in the main account if the function detects an EC2 instance lifecycle change. Add an Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule that invokes the Lambda function every minute.","Configure the permissions on the main account event bus to receive events from all accounts. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule in each account to send all the EC2 instance lifecycle events to the main account event bus. Add an EventBridge rule to the main account event bus that matches all EC2 instance lifecycle events. Set the SQS queue as a target for the rule."],"answer":"D","et_answer":"x"}
