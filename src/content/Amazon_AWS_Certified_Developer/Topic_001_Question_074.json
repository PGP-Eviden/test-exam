The Lambda function polls an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for new messages through a VPC endpoint. Then the function calculates a rolling average of the numeric values that are contained in the messages. After initial tests of the Lambda function, the developer found that the value of the rolling average that the function returned was not accurate.", "", "How can the developer ensure that the function calculates an accurate rolling average?"], "options": ["Set the function's reserved concurrency to 1.
