{"title":"Topic 001 Question 087","body":["You have an application where the frontend is deployed on a managed instance group in subnet A and the data layer is stored on a mysql Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) in subnet B on the same VPC. Subnet A and Subnet B hold several other Compute Engine VMs. You only want to allow the application frontend to access the data in the application's mysql instance on port 3306.","What should you do?",""],"options":["Configure an ingress firewall rule that allows communication from the src IP range of subnet A to the tag \"data-tag\" that is applied to the mysql Compute Engine VM on port 3306.","Configure an ingress firewall rule that allows communication from the frontend's unique service account to the unique service account of the mysql Compute Engine VM on port 3306.","Configure a network tag \"fe-tag\" to be applied to all instances in subnet A and a network tag \"data-tag\" to be applied to all instances in subnet B. Then configure an egress firewall rule that allows communication from Compute Engine VMs tagged with data-tag to destination Compute Engine VMs tagged fe- tag.","Configure a network tag \"fe-tag\" to be applied to all instances in subnet A and a network tag \"data-tag\" to be applied to all instances in subnet B.
