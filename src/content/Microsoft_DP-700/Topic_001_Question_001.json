Company Overview -","","Contoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics.","","","Overview. IT Structure -","","The company’s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems.","","The data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data.","","The data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL.","","","Existing Environment. Fabric -","","Contoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items.","Contoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode.","","Existing Environment. Source Systems","","Contoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales transactions that were processed on the company’s website.","","The company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint.","","Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300\u0026nbsp;MB to 900\u0026nbsp;MB and relate to email interactions.","","Existing Environment. Product Data","","POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables:","","Products -","","ProductCategories -","","ProductSubcategories -","In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories.","","Existing Environment. Azure -","Contoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups:","DataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts","DataEngineers: Contains the data engineers","","Contoso has an Azure subscription.","","The company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric.","Existing Environment. User Problems","The VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric.","","The data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail.","","","Requirements. Planned Changes -","","Contoso plans to create the following two lakehouses:","Lakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources","Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries","Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation.","Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric.","","Requirements. Technical Requirements","","The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization.","","Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers.","","Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible.","The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements:","Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access.","Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses.","","Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements:","The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items.","Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format.","","No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer.","","Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data.","","In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again.","","Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB.","Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed.","","Requirements. Data Transformation","","In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1.","","Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer.","","","Requirements. Data Security -","","Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements:","The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files.","","The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer.","","The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers.","","The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA.","","You need to ensure that the data analysts can access the gold layer lakehouse.","","What should you do?\r"],"options":["Add the DataAnalyst group to the Viewer role for WorkspaceA.\r","Share the lakehouse with the DataAnalysts group and grant the Build reports on the default semantic model permission.\r","Share the lakehouse with the DataAnalysts group and grant the Read all SQL Endpoint data permission.\r","Share the lakehouse with the DataAnalysts group and grant the Read all Apache Spark permission.\r"],"answer":"C","et_answer":"C"}
